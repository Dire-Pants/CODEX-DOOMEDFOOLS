You stand over the dissolving remains of the ochre jelly, newly victorious. The dwarves shuffle over, looking a bit sheepish now that the threat has passed. [[Dazlyn Grayshard]] clears his throat and says:

“We be scholars, not fighters, as I said… even so, we might’ve been of more help to ye. Ye have me thanks, and me coin.” He looks to [[Norbus Ironrune]], his unintelligible companion, and nods. 

[[~Pending Info/Norbus Ironrune|Norbus]] reaches into a bag of holding and wrenches out an ornate dwarven chest. It drops [[~Pending Info/Norbus Ironrune|Norbus]] ground with a heavy thump. [[~Pending Info/Norbus Ironrune|Norbus]] opens the chest almost tenderly, then begins counting out gold pieces. He approaches each of you, as well as [[../Non-Player Characters/Tor'azil Faraeven|Tor'azil Faraeven]], the high elf bard, pressing ten gold coins into each outstretched hand, muttering under his breath all the while.

“That’s fer yer aid, and yer warning, which we’ll heed soon as we’ve cleared the final chamber,” says [[~Pending Info/Dazlyn Grayshard|Dazlyn]]. Then he turns to the doorway that [[../Player Characters/Kro Chadger|Kro Chadger]] “unlocked” with his strange magic. “It’s only right that ye go first. Ye’ve earned it. Shall we?”

As you enter the final chamber, you are struck by the sheer verticality of the space— like the passages before it, the walls yawn upward, disappearing into darkness. There are rows of stone pews, glittering with inlaid gems and precious metals. At the far end of the room is a final, towering statue of the same dwarven figure depicted throughout the ruins. Unlike the other statues you’ve seen, this one is intact, and you can clearly make out the twisted visage of a morbidly rotund dwarf, grinning with unrestrained glee as he holds a bag of coin in one hand and a scroll in the other. In front of the statue is a pedestal, upon which rests a huge ruby, twinkling darkly in the torchlight.

Behind you, you hear [[~Pending Info/Dazlyn Grayshard|Dazlyn]] grumble.

“Should’ve known…” he says. “Tis a shrine to [[Abbathor]], dwarven god of greed,” he explains. “A god most goodly dwarves turn their backs on at a young age. Still, he has his place in the pantheon— a cautionary tale for all enterprisin’ mountain folk, a reason not to overreach. But like all gods, he has his devout. [[~Pending Info/Norbus Ironrune|Norbus]] and I noted signs of battle in the halls beyond this chamber— scars left in the stone, what could only have been caused by powerful divine magic. Seems the worshippers here earned the ire of a stronger god than [[~Pending Info/Abbathor|Abbathor]]… perhaps even the wrath of Moradin himself.” He snorts and spits. “Likely deserved it too. Won’t be sheddin’ a tear fer these fools.” He looks at Norbus. “Let’s get to it, Norby. We’ll start cataloguin’, and we’ll let these adventurers get to lootin’… if there’s anything worth having. Seems to me this chamber is as picked clean as the others, save fer that gem there. But somethin’ about it seems mighty suspicious to me…”
