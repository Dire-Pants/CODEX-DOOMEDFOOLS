# The Days of Thunder— 35,000 BDR (Age of the Creator Races)

— Tumultuous period of global dominion by a god known as the World Serpent and its favored followers, the sarrukh (later the Yuan-ti).

— A time of divine meddling, reckless magic, subjugation, and imbalance.

— Io, god of dragons, summons the Tearfall, a massive asteroid which strikes the region now known as the Sea of Fallen Stars, unleashing dragons on Toril and shattering the Creator Races’ decadent empires. A period of mass extinction follows.


# The Dawn Age— 26,000 BDR (Age of dragons and giants)

— Dragons wipe out most of civilization, with only the giants and titans able to resist their might.

— Draconic empires form, consolidating power. Giants’ and titans’ strength is increasingly diminished.

— Primitive dwarves, halflings, and humans exist on the margins of civilization, going largely unnoticed.

# The First Flowering— 24,000 to 12,000 BDR (Age of elves)

— Elves emerge en masse from the Feywild (an echo of the Material Plane), exploring Faerûn and assessing the extent of the dragons’ power. They practice elven high magic, a subtle but deeply powerful form of magic which exists in harmony with nature. 

— Over the course of hundreds of years, the elves cast a ritual spell that alters the celestial body now known as the King-Killer Star (or Dragon’s Doom), so that whenever it appears in the sky the dragons go mad, slaying each other and eating their own young. 

— This results in the permanent destruction of draconic civilization and alters the very nature of dragons (leading to the solitary chromatic and metallic dragons of today).

— This ushers in 7000 years of relative peace.

— 17,000 BDR: Thirteen elven mages gather to cast a spell in an attempt to manifest the heavens on Toril. Dark elves protest the casting of the spell, in part due to a deep animosity towards the gold elves (who originally conceived of the spell). Seldarine (elven) gods support its casting, deciding the matter. 

— The spell is cast and results in the First Sundering, a fundamental alteration of reality responsible for the creation of Toril’s mirror world, Abeir, as well as the manifestation of the elven paradise, Evermeet, across time and space. Thousands of lives are lost during this time, and many societies collapse, including that of the gold elves. Magic becomes imbalanced and unpredictable, leading to areas of wild magic which still persist today.

# The Crown Wars— 12,000 to 9000 BDR

— First Crown War: Sun elves of Aryvandaar move to annex Miyeritar, an independent city of dark and green elves, as well as the epicenter of elven culture and high magic. This culminates in the martial annexation of Miyeritar by the sun elves.

— Second Crown War: Dark elves of Ilythir declare war on Aryvandaar and its allies, consumed by rage over the subjugation of Miyeritar. They employ dark magic to accomplish their ends, toppling nations and razing ancient forests as they march toward the occupied city.

— Elves rally to Aryvandaar, more fearful of the corrupt magic of the dark elves than of subjugation by the sun elves. Others abandon Faerûn altogether, returning to the Feywild or fleeing across Toril (leading to the emergence of sea elves and other new societies).

— Dark elves reclaim Miyeritar, but are now deeply corrupted, employing necromancy and dominating other races (including dragons) in their efforts to overthrow the sun elves.

— A period of uneasy peace follows Miyeritar’s reclamation by the dark elves, during which time illithids (mindflayers), attracted by the reckless displays of high magic, appear from another plane of reality and quietly populate the Underdark.

— Third Crown War: Sun elves shatter the peace once more, beginning a three-hundred year war resulting in the conquest of the elven nation of Shantel Othreier, south of Miyeritar. 

— The Dark Disaster, also known as the Killing Storms, is summoned over Miyeritar by an unknown figure. Many elves flee, while those that remain perish in the cataclysm. Ninety dark elven mages unite and attempt to calm the storm, wandering into its heart, never to be heard from again. 

— When the Killing Storms finally dissipate some months later, only a blasted, desolate wasteland remains where Miyeritar once stood, a region now known as the High Moor, located southeast of present-day Waterdeep.

— Fourth Crown War: The tragedy provokes a final, direct confrontation between sun elves and dark elves, in which the extent of the dark elves’ corruption is revealed, as demons emerge from the Abyss and ally with the dark elven armies. 

— Driven almost to the brink of destruction, the sun elves and their allies pray for deliverance. Corellon Larethian, overgod of the Seldarine, shocks mortals and gods alike by cursing the entire dark elven race. The dark elves are driven into the Underdark by their sudden intolerance of sunlight, and are utterly cut off from the Seldarine gods (as well as their own identity). This mass exile comes to be known as the Great Descent.

— The displaced dark elves turn to Lolth, the Demon Queen of Spiders (a fallen Seldarine goddess), accepting her as their patron god in this hostile new environment. The now-subterranean dark elves come to be known by elves of the surface as “drow”, derived from the elvish word dhaerow, which means “traitor”.

— The Fifth Crown War: In the aftermath of the upheaval, a delegation of surface elves gathers to determine the party responsible for the millennia of strife, and Aryvandaar is found guilty. A united force of elves then casts down the sun elves of Aryvandaar in a final act of war. The survivors of the conflict eventually become the high elves and wood elves of the present day.

— The elven dominion of Faerûn comes to an end, with the elves forming many smaller, more insular communities throughout the continent. Pockets of former glory persist, such as Evermeet, the High Forest, and Cormanthor (later known as Myth Drannor).

# The Founding Time— 9000 to 3000 BDR (Dawn of humanity)

— The dwarves of Great Bhaerynden, whose underground empire existed in secret for thousands of years, suddenly find themselves surrounded by legions of exiled drow, and are quickly decimated and driven out of their homeland. A period of conflict between drow and dwarves ensues, known as the Spider Wars.

— The dwarven refugees take shelter in the neighboring dwarven kingdom of Old Shanatar (known today as the Great Rift), the ancestors of the present-day shield dwarves.

— A long period of dwarven civil war follows, leading to the exodus of many dwarves to the surface lands above Old Shanatar (the modern-day regions of Tethyr and Amn). These dwarves of the surface later come to be known as gold dwarves.

— Illithids take advantage of the chaos caused by the Spider Wars, isolating and conquering weakened dwarven clans, eventually leading to the creation and enslavement of the duergar (or deep dwarves), who would not achieve freedom from their mindflayer masters for thousands of years.

— During this time, the first human civilizations emerge, seizing power as the influence of the surface elves continues to wane.

— The human empire of Imaskar, in the far reaches of eastern Faerûn, pushes westward across the continent. The Imaskari conquer and enslave those who resist their expansion, masters of strange magic not practiced since the times of the Creator Races. Their empire survives for thousands of years.

— In the southwest, gold dwarves and humans (once allied against the djinni who originally settled the region) go to war, with the humans emerging victorious and forming the nation of Calimshan. The defeated dwarves flee and settle lands further north.

— The Imaskar Empire, weakened by sudden, devastating bouts of plague and famine, comes to a violent end at the hands of a widespread slave rebellion.

— The dwarves disperse both above and below ground in search of a new home, founding far-flung kingdoms and often coming into conflict with humans, goblinoids, and orcs on the surface, as well as drow, duergar, and illithids in the Underdark.

# The Age of Humanity— 3000 BDR to 1489 DR (present)

— Plagued by orc raids, the early Netherese (loosely-affiliated groups of humans situated along the Narrow Sea) ally with a nearby community of elves, who teach them their knowledge of magic so that they may better combat the orcs. The humans go on to master magic to a degree the elves could never have foreseen, establishing the nation of Netheril and constructing enchanted cities atop floating mountains.

— Netheril emerges as the preeminent power of Faerûn, rising to greater heights even than that of the Imaskar Empire.

— Netheril makes contact with a strange being called Arthindol, also known as the Terraseer. Arthindol acts as a sage and diviner, appearing in times of crisis to guide the archwizards of Netheril.

— Shield dwarves establish the kingdom of Delzoun, extending across the Silver Marches as well as deep into the Underdark, achieving a period of stability not known since the fall of Great Bhaerynden.

— Karsus, Netheril’s most powerful archwizard, devises a plot to usurp Mystryl, the goddess of magic, intent on ascending to godhood in her place. The Terraseer encourages Karsus, while also cautioning that if he succeeds, no one will ever look at magic the same way again.

— Karsus devises a spell which he calls Karsus’s Avatar, designed to steal Mystryl’s power. Against all odds, the wizard-prodigy succeeds in its casting, attaining godlike power… but also godlike responsibility. 

— Overwhelmed by the enormity of the Weave, Karsus goes mad, and all the magic of the world goes mad with him. The floating cities of Netheril come crashing down, obliterating the regions surrounding the Narrow Sea, creating the present-day Anauroch Desert. 

— Mystryl sacrifices herself in order to destroy Karsus and restore order. She dies, and is reborn as Mystra, a sterner warden of magic, intent on limiting the power of magic, safeguarding the Weave, and ensuring that Karsus’s Folly is never repeated.

— Survivors of Netheril’s collapse disperse and found new cities and kingdoms throughout Faerûn. Despite the disaster, humans continue to dominate the continent.

— The elven city of Myth Drannor (a vestige of the ancient elven kingdom of Cormanthyr) is declared a safe haven for all the goodly races of the world. Within the city’s borders, elves, dwarves, humans, gnomes, and halflings flourish.

— The human kingdom of Cormyr is established, a nation built on the ethos of fairness and chivalry, ruled by the Obarskyrs, a royal lineage which persists to this day. Cormyr’s military force, the Knights of the Purple Dragon, becomes a mighty force in the land, exemplars of lawful good.
