# Message from the DM:

Stuff to do before session 1:

* Get to know your character race, subrace, and class. Google and ChatGPT are your friends. So is Baldur’s Gate 3. Look for DND 5e resources, as that is the ruleset we’ll be using. It’s really impossible to be over-prepared in this regard. There are a lot of choices to make at the beginning, and choices vary pretty widely depending on your class and background. Also, don’t panic— this is as many decisions as you’ll have to make at once, and if you’re having a hard time you can reach out to me and I’ll help you.

* Pick your background (examples: charlatan, urchin, folk hero, soldier, etc.). There are lists of dnd 5e backgrounds online that should also provide you with the proficiencies and other perks they offer. Try to pick a background that fits the backstory we discussed at session 0. This is also a good time to consider your character’s lifestyle prior to the adventure, whether you were poor, average, wealthy, noble, etc., as that will have some impact on gameplay.

* Pick your proficiencies (not to be confused with attributes/abilities). Proficiencies are your skillsets outside of combat, such as acrobatics, stealth, persuasion, survival, etc. Think of them as the ways your character usually interacts with the world (other than caving in skulls, flinging fireballs, or raising the dead). Some classes have less proficiency options (fighters and barbarians), while others have more proficiency options (rogues and bards). Most backgrounds give you a couple extra proficiencies as well. And just to make it a lil more complicated, your attributes (examples: dexterity, intelligence) make you innately more effective with certain proficiencies (examples: insight, arcana)— for instance, a character with high charisma will be better at persuading and intimidating, a character with high wisdom will be better with perception and insight, dexterity is good with stealth, strength complements athletics, and so on. Picking proficiencies that play off your best attributes is always a good way to go.

* Pick your starting weapon type and armor type (unarmored, light, medium, heavy). At the outset of the campaign you’ll start with basic versions of both choices. You can have one melee weapon (plus a shield, or two light one handed weapons if you are a dual-wielder) as well as one ranged weapon. The choices you are able to make here are determined by your race, subrace, and class. Some races (example: elf) and subraces (example: wood elf) grant additional weapon proficiencies that your class may not have provided. Some classes lock you out of certain choices (i.e. a wizard or monk can’t wear any armor without being penalized).

* Create any unique starting weapons or personal items and send your ideas to me for review.

* Pick your starting spells and abilities if applicable, and be aware of how many spell slots you have (spells are what you know how to cast, spell slots are how many times you can cast per long rest). We will not be using spell components except in rare instances, so disregard any mention of those in dnd resources (also breathe a sigh of relief and thank your DM).

* Things not to worry about as much: money, rations, extra equipment. You can roll for starting money if you want, otherwise I’ll assign it based on your lifestyle prior to the adventure. In general I am going to try to stray away from the micromanagey stuff and try to make it make more sense narratively (like if you decide you’re going on a two week journey through the wilderness, then rations and resources will come into play). Money will gradually matter more, but at the beginning it’s pretty inconsequential. Just like in real life.

* Last but far from least: nerd out and flesh out that backstory. The campaign’s story is just one part of the experience, but the overarching narrative will be influenced by everyone. Think about what your character wants to accomplish on a grander scale, as they get more powerful— do they want to kill a god, avenge a fallen loved one, achieve enlightenment, raise an army of ravenous undead, preserve the natural order… the list goes on, limited only by your imagination. It’s possible you won’t accomplish these goals in this first campaign, but if we keep playing, we could dedicate entire sessions to your personal arcs depending on how things shake out. Ask yourself who your character knew in their past, where they’re from, who their enemies are, what secrets they may be keeping from others. That kind of thing. Make them more to you than numbers and stats, as you’ll be stepping into their shoes, and the more you know about where they came from and where they’re going, the better you’ll roleplay. Good roleplaying will always be rewarded in some way, and is key to making us forget we’re a bunch of dudes sitting at a table.

**This probably seems like a lot, but like I said, this is the biggest series of decisions you’ll have to make at once. Once this is out of the way, you’ll make decisions gradually as you level up and find loot, and things will slowly but surely make more sense. And again, I am happy to nerd out on your behalf and help you with anything that feels annoying or overwhelming.**
