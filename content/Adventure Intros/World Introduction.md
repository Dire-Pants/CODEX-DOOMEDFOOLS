It is earth year 2024 AD, Dalereckoning (DR) 1491 in Faerun. A time of new beginnings!

The campaign is set in the Forgotten Realms, specifically the Sword Coast. As our adventure begins, a motley crew of unlikely allies is forced to band together on the road outside of Phandalin, a town previously razed and ruined hundreds of years earlier, now being rebuilt by a reconstruction effort led by investors from the nearby city of Neverwinter. Rumors of trouble have plagued the region for some months now, and as adventurers you are lured by the possibility of gold and glory. However, you were all attacked on the road to Phandalin by what appeared to be an ice dragon, though you have your doubts that such a creature would roam this far south. Regardless, you decide to band together for safety, and as the adventure begins you and your newfound companions are just outside of Phandalin, intent on finding an inn and some spirits to help wash away the fearsome sight witnessed earlier that dayâ€¦
