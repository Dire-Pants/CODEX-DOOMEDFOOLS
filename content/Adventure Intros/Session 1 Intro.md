When you arrive, it is late evening. You emerge from the tree-line atop a gentle slope, overlooking[[Major Locations/Phandalin|Phandalin]]n— a smattering of darkened buildings, most of its inhabitants already asleep in their beds. A hush has settled over the town… though calling it a town seems a bit grandiose. [[Major Locations/Phandalin|Phandalin]] might be more accurately described as a “settlement” consisting of rough-hewn cabins, bunkhouses, and a single paved street on the central hill, where several gated manors have been erected— the only permanent residences in town. At the heart of the commons is a lone two-story building, light spilling out onto the cold ground outside, a beacon amid the darkened structures. You can’t make out the sign above the doors, but it doesn’t matter. You know what this building is. The town inn, local hub of adventurers, ne’er-do-wells, and the wayward. It is here that you will find refuge for the evening, here that you will begin to sort out what has happened to you, and what will happen next.


Miners are disgruntled with poor wages, their complaints can be heard at the inn and in huddled groups on street corners throughout town. They say the [[../~Pending Info/Miner’s Exchange|Miner’s Exchange]] doesn’t represent their interests, and that the Townmaster is a puffed-up aristocrat from [[Neverwinter]], here to see that no one escapes the status quo. “There ain’t no new lives to be had here,” says one miner. “Not even a new place. Just some roughshod cabins, hopeful fools, and the ruins of what came before.”
