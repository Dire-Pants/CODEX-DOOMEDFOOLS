# Character Rough Concept:

My Question about Kings & Queens:

Stoked to see another side of you Jared! And Edison there are definitely kings and queens.  Not so much on the sword coast… think fantasy PNW. It’s a rugged natural landscape with pockets of individualistic civilization in major cities like Waterdeep and Baldur’s Gate. Gets more deserty the further south you go, and there are other confederacies, kingdoms, city-states, and countries all across Faerun. I think Cormyr to the east is a kingdom with knights and chivalry vibes. Neverwinter is the nearest city to us— they are run by a duke. Also gods play an active role in Faerun and lots of people have a patron deity.
#### Starting the First Session
Gentlemen, the time has come. It is earth year 2024 AD, Dalereckoning (DR) 1491 in Faerun. A time of new beginnings! Lemme know if there’s an evening this week that works for everybody. I can also try to figure out how to make a poll if that’s easier… 
### Potential Quotes:
With my corrupted crown and my lovely scapegoats I am ambassador to their demise. Praise Bane, Highest of All. I count the days to secure a position of honor in the Banehold. 
# Main Motivations
Crown switch. Convince the group I have a crown that was found on the body of bandits. They seemed to have swapped out the actual for a counterfeit. As I level up enough I would like to let the group know what I stumbled upon (I am actually holding the counterfeit but there is no way to discern it without actually comparing it to the actual). Prior to revealing this to the team I would like to do a solo infiltration mission to a)swap the kings crown and then let the team know the actual one can be returned or b) convince the king the crown on his head is a fake and I know the adventurers that are en route to return it to it's rightful place. Maybe explain the exact features and where the slight deviations are.  I would like to prove it to him with some sort of alchemical test or deception. I would then like to devise a plan to give the crown the fake corrupted crown imbued with assassin's poison. I would like it to be administered via a very tiny pin prick sieve that funnels enough poison to kill a large demon.

## Class Choice:
HALF-ELF DRUID MULTICLASSING AS ROGUE going for the Assassin Archetype

 i chose rogue because i realized i could almost avoid combat entirely just by sneaking around getting the team gear  plus if there are other rogues you can work together if your assassination rogue  and the other rogues thief you can kill somebody make it look like the thief rogue did it then the thief rogue could get out of there in seconds  and you just got a free kill and if you want to kill a lot of enemies just have the thief rogue light the building on fire
## Race Common Lore
Half-Elf: https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/20-half-elf

> An individual with one human parent and one elven parent (including Drow heritage).
Can inherit physical traits from both parent races, leading to a wide range of appearances.
Often straddle the line between human and elven cultures, facing prejudice from both sides.
Have the potential to inherit some magical abilities from their elven lineage.

>Walking in two worlds but truly belonging to neither, half-elves combine what some say are the best qualities of their elf and human parents: human curiosity, inventiveness, and ambition tempered by the refined senses, love of nature, and artistic tastes of the elves. Some half-elves live among humans, set apart by their emotional and physical differences, watching friends and loved ones age while time barely touches them. Others live with the elves, growing restless as they reach adulthood in the timeless elven realms, while their peers continue to live as children. Many half-elves, unable to fit into either society, choose lives of solitary wandering or join with other misfits and outcasts in the adventuring life.

>Half-elves have no lands of their own, though they are welcome in human cities and somewhat less welcome in elven forests. In large cities in regions where elves and humans interact often, half-elves are sometimes numerous enough to form small communities of their own. They enjoy the company of other half-elves, the only people who truly understand what it is to live between these two worlds.

>In most parts of the world, though, half-elves are uncommon enough that one might live for years without meeting another. Some half-elves prefer to avoid company altogether, wandering the wilds as trappers, foresters, hunters, or adventurers and visiting civilization only rarely. Like elves, they are driven by the wanderlust that comes of their longevity. Others, in contrast, throw themselves into the thick of society, putting their charisma and social skills to great use in diplomatic roles or as swindlers.
Half-Elf Names

>Half-elves use either human or elven naming conventions. As if to emphasize that they don’t really fit in to either society, half-elves raised among humans are often given elven names, and those raised among elves often take human names.

__EXCELLENT AMBASSADORS

>Many half-elves learn at an early age to get along with everyone, defusing hostility and finding common ground. As a race, they have elven grace without elven aloofness and human energy without human boorishness. They often make excellent ambassadors and go-betweens (except between elves and humans, since each side suspects the half-elf of favoring the other).

# Role-Playing:

## Backstory:

I am a bastard or orphan as far as I know. I grew up in a monk monastery meditating and training and helping neighbors with hunts. On return from a particularly grueling hunt, I returned to my cloister burned down as everyone slept... forcing me to leave my structured, communal lifestyle to become a wanderer. Trying to live off of the land I became finely aware of herb procurement and became a notable traveling herbalist.. Due to my half elf nature, not being trusted by elves or humans entirely, I was often not welcome in one place for too long.. My humble cloister leaving me with no strong affiliation or familiarity to anyone. I decided to make refuge in a refined hut in "TBD" trying to resign to a hermit like existence. I helped fellow wanderers with their ailments, cuts and bruises and traded with merchants for my high quality curatives. In order to appease the shadier figures moving through those parts, I was often strong armed by these folk regularly to provide the precursor herbs to create foul concoctions I want no credit for. After being strong armed for several seasons for more and more of these scarce shady herbs, I returned one night to my hut on fire. A strange echo of my former commune. I packed what belongings remained and headed toward Phandalin. 

Monk/Rogue is a powerful combo as both classes benefit from Dexterity as their primary ability score. This allows them to deal high damage, move quickly, and utilize many of the same skills.

## Skill Check
1. **Undercover Agent:** Pair your rogue-assassin with a class like Ranger (Gloom Stalker) or Cleric (Trickery domain) to be a deep-cover operative working for a secret society or hidden power. Use your herbalism and poisons for covert missions, gather intel on your party, and sow discord from within. This allows you to be antagonistic without directly targeting your fellow players.
    
2. **Ruthless Duelist:** Multiclass into Fighter (Battle Master) or Monk (Open Hand) to become a formidable combatant. Focus on precise strikes and debilitating techniques, using your herbalism and poisons to enhance your lethality. You can challenge party members to duels or engage in tense confrontations without resorting to framing or betrayal.
    
3. **Poison Master:** Combine your rogue-assassin with an Alchemist subclass from any spellcasting class (Wizard, Artificer, etc.) to craft potent poisons and concoctions. Become the party's "chemist," offering beneficial potions while secretly developing deadly toxins. This lets you play with the dark side of your herbalism without directly targeting your party.
    

Remember, a well-developed villain is still a valuable contributor to the story. You can be a source of tension, intrigue, and moral dilemmas for your party without resorting to actions that could ruin the gameplay experience for others.

## Feats Explained:

https://dicecove.com/feats/guide/

A feat enhances one aspect of your character with a more powerful ability; with something unique, or an extra option to choose from. 

Choosing a feat comes with a cost though, as you have to give up an ability score improvement to do so. For spell casters, it’s advisable to increase your spellcasting ability before choosing a feat. This means that your spell save Difficulty Class (DC) will be as high as possible. It’s not a great feeling when a high-level spell that you’ve been saving up for that big fight fizzles away!

Bear in mind that your ability score modifier increases each time your ability score reaches an even number. Certain feats can boost your ability scores by one point. So if your ability score is an odd number, and you choose a feat that boosts that ability score, the ability score modifier will also increase. Magic items too can play a part in boosting your abilities, so remember that when planning your character progression.
