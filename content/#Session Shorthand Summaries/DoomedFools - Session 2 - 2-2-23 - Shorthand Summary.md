Deliberation over the skull
Kro healed
Jost shoots an arrow as we nervously watch
Kro is ready to catch it if it falls
Jost attempts to intimidate dwarves for more info
Bract loses patience and chucks another pot

Explosion trap and we all survive
Ruby falls
Voices emit and try to convince the group to summon them.. team is unenthusiastic 
Rook uses magic attunement to unleash them from the stone
A wizard comes forth..Gizmo! And his creature a quasit, a creature from the abyss
They hate each other. 
Quasit is from the abyss and was once a dwarf. Becomes slave to rook and is returned to Ruby 

Rook is thirsty for the bag of holding 
So is Gizmo
Everyone finds that more valuable than any job reward
Kro is naive but inquisitive and excited about small details around him
Dwarves getting nervous about being mugged
Gizmo fumbles the bag and farts

The group is initially disinterested and wary of the gnome wizard 
We depart to the gorge/valley
We encounter a blue robed figure
Bract gathers more herbs
Bract approaches Wizard for a sale and they declined pipeweed

Sizes us up and realizes our backstories:
Rook?? (wasn't paying attention)
Bract called out for violence and his hermit nature 
Jost is grieved and weakened from his anger
Tor is hiding his true colors behind a mask
Gizmo denies death, no friends
Kro boy pretending to be a hero


Kro is adamant about his new friends being good and excitement for adventure 
Vane is adamant and claims he is a harbinger of ill tidings
He vanishes

Gizmo didnt sleep well in the ruby and is saltyy

Kro invites Gizmo into Journey
Group meekly accepts
Bract is mesmerized in a near unbreakable trance as he gazes unblinkingly into a flame he built that doubled as a campfire.
Group had a distaste for the wizard encounter
Kro trust Jost

Jost gathers small game and herbs for bract
Gizmo find and holds onto a squirrel carcass
Bract explains his herbal skills translate to good cooking as well
Rook grunts non comitally and eats his own ration
Food tasted good but the minor herbs provided more random sneezing/burping/farting for an extended time. 

Group returns to Phandalin and stops at Temple
Goddess of luck smiles upon Kro again for an offering
Gizmo leaves squirrel carcass, feels cold icy rejection from Goddess
Another coin is added on top of the dead squirrel..which kind of negates the weirdness

Harbin is harassed by group as they revisit
Gregory half ogre butler shows up 
Greggyboi Threatens us
We inform we finished aided the dwarves

Harbin is so annoyed with us as we antagonize him more
4 gold each reward from Harbin, we were all shorted 1 gold do to the harassment, stingy!

Bract tried to mention more rogue-like approaches to deal with the dragon
He Mentions tracking the dragon and stealthily poisoning it with assassin's blood, a hard to concoct poison that would require high end resources and time to create.
Harvin shoos us away and tells us to keep proving ourselves.

We go to the Tavern and enjoys drinks 
Bract offers a round on the house after the successful job
Bract wants to use the rest of the minor herbs to play with the townfolk with a minor effect but is eyeballed too closely. The miners enjoy the free round and look slightly less annoyed at the spiritual monk. 

Tor thinks we have potential
Rook mentions the wizards characterizations and also being masked
Tor is pressed and mentions he is also hiding his physical features 

Jost tries to expose him, perceives he is wearing something enchanted to hide Identity, not a shape shifter
Tor feels pressured and then reveals secret
Tor pulls of a mask and reveals identity face of a dark elf compared to a high elf
That explains the eyes

Rook is worldly and recognizes he is a dark elf and asks him whats he's doing on the surface 
"Bragen da aertha"
Male dark elf matriarchal society, male elves looked upon disfavorably
He was part of a mercenary and broke ties with a dark group
Sought more virtuous life Concealing identity for racism, wants character to be viewed

Kro wholesome and accepting
Bract laughed at his pursuit of virtue.
