# Session Length
 * Approximately 5 hours

# Aventure Intros:
You stand over the dissolving remains of the ochre jelly, newly victorious. The dwarves shuffle over, looking a bit sheepish now that the threat has passed. [[Dazlyn Grayshard]] clears his throat and says:

“We be scholars, not fighters, as I said… even so, we might’ve been of more help to ye. Ye have me thanks, and me coin.” He looks to [[Norbus Ironrune]], his unintelligible companion, and nods. 

[[~Pending Info/Norbus Ironrune|Norbus]] reaches into a bag of holding and wrenches out an ornate dwarven chest. It drops [[~Pending Info/Norbus Ironrune|Norbus]] ground with a heavy thump. [[~Pending Info/Norbus Ironrune|Norbus]] opens the chest almost tenderly, then begins counting out gold pieces. He approaches each of you, as well as [[../Non-Player Characters/Tor'azil Faraeven|Tor'azil Faraeven]], the high elf bard, pressing ten gold coins into each outstretched hand, muttering under his breath all the while.

“That’s fer yer aid, and yer warning, which we’ll heed soon as we’ve cleared the final chamber,” says [[~Pending Info/Dazlyn Grayshard|Dazlyn]]. Then he turns to the doorway that [[../Player Characters/Kro Chadger|Kro Chadger]] “unlocked” with his strange magic. “It’s only right that ye go first. Ye’ve earned it. Shall we?”

As you enter the final chamber, you are struck by the sheer verticality of the space— like the passages before it, the walls yawn upward, disappearing into darkness. There are rows of stone pews, glittering with inlaid gems and precious metals. At the far end of the room is a final, towering statue of the same dwarven figure depicted throughout the ruins. Unlike the other statues you’ve seen, this one is intact, and you can clearly make out the twisted visage of a morbidly rotund dwarf, grinning with unrestrained glee as he holds a bag of coin in one hand and a scroll in the other. In front of the statue is a pedestal, upon which rests a huge ruby, twinkling darkly in the torchlight.

Behind you, you hear [[~Pending Info/Dazlyn Grayshard|Dazlyn]] grumble.

“Should’ve known…” he says. “Tis a shrine to [[Abbathor]], dwarven god of greed,” he explains. “A god most goodly dwarves turn their backs on at a young age. Still, he has his place in the pantheon— a cautionary tale for all enterprisin’ mountain folk, a reason not to overreach. But like all gods, he has his devout. [[~Pending Info/Norbus Ironrune|Norbus]] and I noted signs of battle in the halls beyond this chamber— scars left in the stone, what could only have been caused by powerful divine magic. Seems the worshippers here earned the ire of a stronger god than [[~Pending Info/Abbathor|Abbathor]]… perhaps even the wrath of Moradin himself.” He snorts and spits. “Likely deserved it too. Won’t be sheddin’ a tear fer these fools.” He looks at Norbus. “Let’s get to it, Norby. We’ll start cataloguin’, and we’ll let these adventurers get to lootin’… if there’s anything worth having. Seems to me this chamber is as picked clean as the others, save fer that gem there. But somethin’ about it seems mighty suspicious to me…”

# Event Summary
The Doomed Fools took a moment to collect themselves after their victory over the ochre jelly, [[Kro Chadger]] returning to his normal, affable self after having entered a seemingly magical trance during the battle. He appeared to be completely unaware of the severity of his wounds. 

[[~Pending Info/Dazlyn Grayshard|Dazlyn]] [[~Pending Info/Dazlyn Grayshard|Grayshard]] apologized to the adventurers for not having done more during the fight, then motioned to his fellow surveyor, [[Norbus Ironrune]], who produced an ornate chest from the Bag of Holding tied to his belt. The dwarf counted out five gold pieces for each of the Fools as thanks for the rescue, but [[Player Characters/Rook Brightscales|Rook]] seemed more interested in the Bag of Holding itself.

After the exchange, the Doomed Fools followed the dwarves into the final chamber, where they were met with a massive statue of the same dwarven figure they’d seen depicted throughout the ruins. On a marble pedestal in front of the statue rested a dwarven skull, with a glittering ruby set in one empty eye socket.

[[~Pending Info/Dazlyn Grayshard|Dazlyn]] revealed that the ruins were likely once a shrine to [[~Pending Info/Abbathor|Abbathor]], dwarven god of greed. He explained that he’d noted traces of divine magic and scars in the stone, which suggested that the shrine had been attacked and destroyed by priests of an opposing god, perhaps even Moradin himself. Eyeing the ruby on the pedestal, he also suggested that the gem was a relic from the temple, and likely trapped.

After some deliberation, Jøst opted to shoot an arrow at the skull from a distance, but just barely overshot his mark. [[Player Characters/Bract|Bract]] then sprinted back into the chamber with yet another ancient urn in hand, which he expertly flung at the skull. 

The instant the urn made contact with the skull, the trap detonated, vaporizing the skull and sending shards of shattered marble raining down on everyone. When the dust settled, only the ruby remained, mysteriously unharmed.

Egged on by Kro, [[Player Characters/Rook Brightscales|Rook]] picked up the ruby and heard a voice call out from the depths of the gem, begging to be released. The voice was interrupted by yet another, more fiendish cry from within the ruby. Sensing the urgency of the matter, [[Player Characters/Rook Brightscales|Rook]] reluctantly tapped into the magic of the ruby, summoning its prisoners back to the Material Plane.

Tendrils of shadow resolved themselves into a battered and exhausted gnome wizard by the name of [[../Player Characters/Gizmo Tinkertits|Gizmo Tinkertits]](who seemed thoroughly relieved to be freed from his prison) as well as the ruby’s coinhabitant, an ornery [[quasit]] called [[Bungheap]] (or, Lost-to-me, according to [[Kro Chadger]]). 

The [[~Pending Info/quasit|quasit]] wasted no time making its opinion of [[Player Characters/Gizmo Tinkertits|Gizmo]] known, explaining that it would have eaten the “filthy” gnome, if only it had been able to catch him. It then promptly swore its allegiance to [[Player Characters/Rook Brightscales|Rook]], its new master, starting to explain that it had once been a dwarf priest before being unceremoniously summoned back into the ruby by the unimpressed Dragonborn.

[[Player Characters/Rook Brightscales|Rook]] approached the dwarves once more, attempting to intimidate [[~Pending Info/Dazlyn Grayshard|Dazlyn]] into giving him Norbus’s Bag of Holding. This piqued Gizmo’s interest, who conjured a mage hand and an illusory decoy Bag of Holding, a display which both dwarves watched with bemusement. Abandoning the tact, [[Player Characters/Gizmo Tinkertits|Gizmo]] then sprinted and lunged at [[~Pending Info/Norbus Ironrune|Norbus]], missing the dwarf completely, tumbling to the ground and letting out a fart in the process. [[~Pending Info/Dazlyn Grayshard|Dazlyn]], truly ruffled at this point, suggested it was time for the adventurers to move on.

[[Player Characters/Gizmo Tinkertits|Gizmo]] asked if he could join the party, but was met with disinterest by the group, who departed without him. Tor remained behind, placing a hand on Gizmo’s shoulder and saying he was welcome to join them in their travels.

The party (with [[Player Characters/Gizmo Tinkertits|Gizmo]] in tow) retraced their steps through the ruins and emerged once more in the gulch, where a mysterious figure in blue robes waited to meet them. At their approach, the robed figure drew back his hood, introducing himself as the wizard Vane Crios (to Kro’s amazement and delight).

Vane proved to be no friend of the Fools however, quickly setting about discouraging them from pursuing the dragon, assuring them that such a quest would lead only to their deaths. 

Frustrated when the party remained unconvinced, Vane stood before each adventurer in turn, revealing unsettling truths about their pasts and present, despite none having encountered the wizard before.

Vane shared that [[Player Characters/Rook Brightscales|Rook]] fancied himself wiser than the gods (and that this would be his undoing), [[Player Characters/Bract|Bract]] meditated on violent ambitions in the night, Jøst’s taciturn nature was a mere disguise for his grief, Tor hid his true colors behind a pretty mask, [[Player Characters/Gizmo Tinkertits|Gizmo]] was a friendless gnome who “denied Death its due”, and Kro was as simple as he looked— a mere boy and not a hero.

Kro, completely unphased, asked Vane if he would agree to be his teacher. Vane insisted that he was not there in any friendly capacity, but rather as a “harbinger of ill tidings”. He then disappeared in a flash of blue light, leaving the adventurers to grapple with the wizard’s revelations.

At camp that evening, [[Player Characters/Bract|Bract]] was unresponsive, staring into the flames of the campfire, seeming deeply troubled. He offered to cook dinner when Jøst returned with a brace of rabbit and some herbs. The meal was passingly tasty, but also upset the stomachs of those who agreed to eat it. 

There was some conversation about the wizard’s portents around the fire. Jøst revealed that he was in fact bereaved, having lost his brother some years before. Kro expressed that he was not put off by Jøst’s demeanor, and had faith in him.

When the adventurers arrived in town the following evening, Kro left another coin offering at the Shrine of Luck, which inspired [[Player Characters/Gizmo Tinkertits|Gizmo]] to leave the carcass of a squirrel he’d discovered the night before. Tymora, goddess of luck, seemed pleased with Kro’s offering and baffled by Gizmo’s.

The party then returned to the Townmaster’s Hall, [[Player Characters/Rook Brightscales|Rook]] once more announcing his presence with a draconic roar. Furious, [[Non-Player Characters/Harbin Western|Harbin]] sent his half-ogre “butler” [[Non-Player Characters/Butler Gregory|Gregory]] to receive the party. The hideous creature flung the doors open, his bulging muscles visible under his ill-fitting servant’s uniform.

After the situation deescalated somewhat, [[Non-Player Characters/Harbin Western|Harbin]] agreed to pay the Doomed Fools a reduced reward, then, after rejecting Kro’s theory that he was secretly a virtuous man, as well as expressing disdain for [[Bract]]’s plan to poison the dragon, he shooed the adventurers away, telling them not to return until they’d completed another task.

The adventurers made their way back to the [[Stonehill Inn]], where [[Player Characters/Bract|Bract]] bought everyone a round of drinks (which he most certainly did not try to alter with herbs).

[[Player Characters/Rook Brightscales|Rook]] took the opportunity to press Tor about the “mask” the wizard had mentioned. Not satisfied with Tor’s evasive response, [[Player Characters/Rook Brightscales|Rook]] reached out with divine magic and detected a shimmering aura around Tor.

Sensing that he could no longer keep his secret, Tor gathered the party and led them down an alley outside of the inn, where he removed the enchanted mask he’d been wearing. Without the mask’s illusory magic, his true nature as a dark elf was revealed.

Tor explained that he concealed his appearance so that he could make his way through the surface world in peace. He shared that he was born in Menzoberranzan, the subterranean city of the dark elves, and had fled the oppression of the matriarchal clerics of Lolth by joining a mercenary group called Bregan D’aerthe, the exploits of which eventually led to his exile on the surface, where he became a follower of Eilistraee, the dark elven goddess of freedom. 

The bard concluded by saying that what he’d initially told the party still held true— he saw the makings of heroes in them, and thought their tale ought to be told. He also expressed a desire to redeem himself for wrongdoings committed in the past.

Surprising everyone (and defying a deeply ingrained hatred between the elves of the surface and their subterranean cousins), Jøst gave Tor a warm reception, saying that he saw the truth in the dark elf’s words. Kro, [[Player Characters/Gizmo Tinkertits|Gizmo]], and [[Player Characters/Rook Brightscales|Rook]] followed suit, as did [[Player Characters/Bract|Bract]], albeit with a derisive laugh at Tor’s stated desire to commit virtuous deeds.

Kro asked Tor if he would consider giving him his mask, and Tor promised that if there came a day when he could travel freely among them, he would gladly relinquish the artifact.

The party then turned in for the night, with [[Player Characters/Gizmo Tinkertits|Gizmo]] bunking up with [[Player Characters/Rook Brightscales|Rook]] and Kro, the latter of which offered the gnome his bed so that he wouldn’t have to sleep on the floor. A few hours of rest were had, interrupted by screams in the night. [[Player Characters/Bract|Bract]] was the first to be roused by the cries, quickly gathering the party. 

The Fools ran out of the inn and were met with chaos and carnage. The town was under attack by a goblin raiding party led by a mysterious orc in tattered robes.

Jøst immediately felled two of the goblins with an enchanted arrow of thorns as the rest of the party spread out to keep the goblins at bay. 

In the chaos, two villagers were slain, while a third— one of the Stonehill’s barmaids— was ushered away to safety by [[Player Characters/Bract|Bract]].

Once the orc leader was slain, the remaining goblins fled. [[Player Characters/Gizmo Tinkertits|Gizmo]] then approached the corpse and wrested an insignia from the creature’s robes. He recognized it as the symbol of Talos, god of chaos and storms— an ill omen indeed.

# Notable actions:

[[Player Characters/Rook Brightscales|Rook]] toed the line between hero and brigand, attempting to intimidate the rescued dwarves into relinquishing their Bag of Holding, evidently thinking the item to be a more fitting reward for his efforts. He also continued to hold his own in battle, preferring to be at the front lines once again.

Jøst’s icy demeanor thawed somewhat as the party continued to work together, with Kro in particular doing his part to make the ranger feel welcome. The wood elf proved to be a deadly opponent in combat, felling two enemies with a single blow.

[[Player Characters/Gizmo Tinkertits|Gizmo]] initially had a hard time convincing the party to accept him, but later proved his usefulness in battle. He was unusually preoccupied with the skeletal corpse of a squirrel, suggesting that he might have an affinity for dead things.

[[Player Characters/Bract|Bract]] was the most affected by Vane Crios’s revelations, withdrawing into himself for some time before attempting to smooth things over by making dinner at camp. He expressed interest in poisoning the dragon rather than confronting it head-on, saying he may be able to concoct a poison called Assassin’s Blood to slay the beast.

Kro continued to meet each person and obstacle with relentless cheer, insisting on seeing the best in everything. He was completely undeterred by the rudeness of some of the folk the party encountered, as well as the quickest to accept any seeming flaws in his companions.
