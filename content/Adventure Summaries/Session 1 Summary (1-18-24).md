# Event Summary
The adventurers arrived in [[Phandalin]] late in the evening, and were quickly dubbed “the Doomed Fools” by [[Kro Chadger]], who overheard some of the local townsfolk muttering the phrase under their breath while the party passed by.

They received a chilly reception from the miners at [[Stonehill Inn]], who were overheard grumbling about low wages and poor representation from the [[Miner’s Exchange]], a local tradesmen’s guild created to represent the local laborers. 

[[Bract]], a loner and orphan, quickly became inebriated due to his inexperience with alcohol, having been raised at a monastery (a home that was also destroyed, though perhaps not as spectacularly as his cottage), and then went on to drunkenly meditate on the bar, a spectacle which was poorly received by the simple miners, unaccustomed to such displays of spirituality.

[[../Player Characters/Rook Brightscales]] was the first to notice the hooded figure observing the party from across the room, and was also able to get a good read on the other patrons, who appeared to be generally disgruntled, but otherwise indifferent to the party.

Jøst, who was frustrated to find himself in civilized lands, abstained from any drinks, instead stating that he had his own flask, though he was not seen drinking from it.

[[../Non-Player Characters/Toblen Stonehill]], the barkeep, responded to the adventurers’ inquiries regarding the dragon with skepticism, explaining that it was likely just a wyvern that had morphed into a dragon through exaggeration and the bluster of eyewitnesses. He acknowledged that orcs had become more active in recent months, and also made mention of a Drow spotted in the area (an idea he seemed none-too-pleased by).

After approaching [[Tor'azil Faraeven|Tor’azil Faraeven]], the high elf bard, Jøst became suspicious of the elf’s interest in the party. He noticed that Tor’s eyes were an unusual shade of yellow, which struck him as an odd detail, though not an impossible eye color for an elf. Beyond that, he was not able to detect any outright deceit. 

Tor explained that he is an adventurer himself, and is motivated by a desire to witness deeds worthy of song, suggesting that he sees potential in the Doomed Fools. Not much else was gleaned about the high elf, except that he’d been in town for several weeks, played a few songs at the inn most evenings, and had seen many adventurers pass through the region, investigating claims of the dragon only to disappear, never to be heard from again.

The party agreed to meet Tor outside the inn the following morning and accompany him to the Townmaster’s Hall atop the hill in the center of town. 

Kro surprises everyone by speaking fluent elvish to Jøst, who takes the revelation in stride.

[[Bract]], despite being a half-elf and thus unable to enter the elven trance, spends the evening sitting in a lotus position and is well-rested the next morning, suggesting an unusual degree of discipline.

At Kro’s insistence, the party took a detour to the Shrine of Tymora, Goddess of Luck, in search of Sister Garaele, the elven priestess who tends the shrine. Kro was adamant about finding a “wizard in blue robes” whom Toblen had mentioned the night before, suggesting that the Sister might know more. However, Sister Garaele was not at the shrine that morning, and the party returned to a patiently-waiting Tor empty handed.

The Doomed Fools then made their way to [[Harbin Western|Harbin]] Wester’s estate, where they were received by the Townmaster by means of an intricate communication system installed in the manor. [[../Player Characters/Rook Brightscales]] kicked off the dialogue by roaring into the horn beside [[Harbin Western|Harbin]], terrifying [[Harbin Western|Harbin]] and making the worst possible first impression.

Kro asked who was in charge, mentioning his uncle’s tale of the Rockseeker brothers, only to be met with disdain by the Townmaster, who insisted that he is the sole power in [[Phandalin]], backed by Neverwinter aristocracy. Flustered by [[../Player Characters/Rook Brightscales|Rook's]] roar and the unneeded knocks on the door that followed, [[Harbin Western|Harbin]] shooed the party away after threatening to sic a servant named [[Butler Gregory|Gregory]]” on them if they insisted on causing a ruckus, telling the adventurers to look at the job postings on the board in the town square, and warning that they should not return to his doorstep empty-handed. After the[[Harbin Western|Harbin]] acquiesced, [[Harbin Western|Harbin]] was overheard telling [[Butler Gregory|Gregory]] to “stand down”.

After looking at the town board job listings (and the additional note left by an unknown party, proudly proclaiming that “Pipeweed is the titties”), the adventurers elected to travel to the dwarven excavation and warn the dwarves of the possible dragon in the area.

The party arrived in the gulch where the excavation site was located a day later, and quickly entered the ruins after surmising that no one was outside. They were soon discovered and questioned by the dwarven excavators, Dazlyn Grayshard and Norbus Ironrune, surveyors belonging to Clan Battlehammer of Mithral Hall, far to the north. The dwarves were alarmed by the report of the dragon, but insisted that they would not leave the excavation site empty-handed, explaining that there was one chamber which they’d been unable to access.

The party notices a series of crumbling statues in alcoves along the walls deeper into the complex, depicting a dwarf who is surrounded by wealth (worthless stone reproductions of wealth, to be precise), holding bags of coins in his hands.

The Doomed Fools agreed to aid the dwarves, with Kro ultimately taking the initiative and attacking the door with his axe, destroying the enchantment through virtue of his own innate magic. In doing so, he unwittingly triggered the final trap in the outer chambers, releasing an ochre jelly which was then dispatched by the adventurers (with some help from Tor and no help from the dwarves).

[[../Player Characters/Rook Brightscales]] dealt the final blow, releasing a fiery breath which dissolved the ochre jelly and its clone, and also badly injured Kro (who, due to his magically-induced rage, failed to notice the blunder).


# Notable character actions:


[[../Player Characters/Rook Brightscales]], a lone wanderer from a clan of wandering Dragonborn, seemed to have a preexisting relationship with dragons, visibly darkening at Kro’s question about him being related to them, and perking up whenever there was an opportunity to learn more about the supposed dragon in the area. He was also seen drawing divine strength from his unusual pickaxe, the head of which appeared to be fashioned from bone.

Jøst the wood elf ranger maintained a gruff demeanor and kept a cool distance from others, wary of his newfound companions and dismayed at the prospect of being away from the wilds. He also viewed Tor with suspicion, keeping a watchful eye on the bard. When questioned about his own motives by Kro, Jøst explained that he’d been making his way to [[Phandalin]] to engage in trade, though he refused to trade with Kro after the young carpenter expressed interest in doing so.

[[Bract]] the half-elf monk and herbalist, still recovering from the shock of his icily-exploded roadside cottage, was alternately impulsive and full of monastic platitudes, making frequent references to maintaining a “stillness of the mind”, while also taking some surprising courses of action, such as meditating on the bar counter, stroking the tip of Tor’s ear when first meeting him, as well as attempting to pluck a string of the bard’s lute. As the party traveled to the excavation site [[Bract]] kept a keen eye out for useful herbs, and when it came to combat later on, he opted to fight from afar, flinging ancient pottery at the ochre jelly from the shadows.

Kro the human carpenter was enamored by pretty much everything he came across (especially woodwork), making it clear to his companions that he is a sheltered and good-natured young man on his first real adventure in the world. Despite this naïveté, it seems he was armed with some valuable knowledge by his father and uncle, both of whom he holds in high regard. He also expressed a fervent interest in magic and finding a wizard to learn from, and quickly developed an admiration (perhaps even awe) for the Dragonborn cleric, [[../Player Characters/Rook Brightscales|Rook Brightscales]].
