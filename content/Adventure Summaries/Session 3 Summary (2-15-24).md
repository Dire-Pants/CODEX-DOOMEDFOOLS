 * Approx 4 hours (6:30PM-1030PM)

# Event Summary
— In the aftermath of the goblin raid, Kro Chadger collapsed, having taken two goblin arrows to the back during the fighting (but in typical Kro fashion, was totally unaware of the injuries in the throes of his rage). Tor was able to stabilize the young warrior with bardic magic, who was then laid up in bed back at the Stonehill Inn. 

— The party (sans Kro) awoke the morning after the raid to a bar full of appreciative survivors, as well as a thoroughly impressed barkeep. Toblen rewarded the party for their efforts with free rooms for the remainder of their stay, as well as some Blood Rashemens, an old family recipe. He also shared that it was their efforts that made the difference the night before, as Harbin Wester and the other aristocrats hid behind the walls of their manors.

— Bract added his own blend of spices and extracts to the Bloody Rashemen, far surpassing Toblen’s expectations and prompting the barkeep to offer the monk a job in the culinary industry, should he grow weary of the adventuring life.

— The Fools lingered for a bit, discussing a myriad of subjects with the barkeep, including how much booze it would take to incapacitate a dragon. Toblen wasn’t sure, but suspected it would be a truly monumental amount. He then informed the party that Sister Garaele had returned in the wee hours of the morning, and was tending to the wounded at the Shrine of Tymora.

— The Doomed Fools set out to speak to the sister, whom they found amid a cluster of wounded villagers on straw mats. She greeted Tor in Elvish upon the bard’s approach, a flicker of recognition in her eyes, an interaction which may have inspired some jealousy in Jøst, whose encounters with high elves were limited due to his isolated upbringing.

— Garaele then turned to Bract, whom she recognized as the “Hermit of Triboar Trail”. She smiled somewhat cryptically, saying that the monk’s reputation preceded him. Bract appeared uncomfortable with the recognition, asking the sister if she had heard tales of his healing prowess, to which she responded that she had heard tales of his aptitude for “certain arts”. Bract changed the subject, asking Sister Garaele where she had disappeared to (a query she brushed off, saying she’d been visiting devotees of Tymora in Neverwinter).

— After the introductions, Garaele asked the party if they could tell her anything about the town’s assailants. Gizmo produced the insignia of Talos that he’d taken from the fallen orc. Sister Garaele frowned as she studied it, sharing that Talos’ presence did not bode well for Phandalin. Rook, who had also studied the insignia, corroborated this, beginning to suspect that there was more going on in the region than a lone ice dragon could account for.

— Sister Garaele told the party that in addition to darkness without the town’s borders, there was darkness within. She explained that a few years ago, Phandalin had truly been a beacon for those who sought opportunity and a chance at a new life, but something had happened to change that— something more insidious than could be explained by a greedy and cowardly Townmaster. This seemed a personal affront to the sister, who shared that there was no greater sacrilege to followers of Tymora than to rig the scales of luck in one’s favor, at the expense of others.

— Gizmo, who seemed more enamored by Sister Garaele’s appearance than anything she had to say, showered the high elf with compliments. Garaele put a hand on the gnome’s shoulder and intimated that she perceived darkness and conflict in him, and expressed the hope that his path would lead him to lighter places. In thanks for Gizmo’s “offering to Tymora, she shared that he would soon face mortal danger, but that luck would be on his side. 

— Gizmo, undeterred by the sister’s observations, asked her if there was any way they might keep in touch. Smiling in spite of herself, Garaele gave the gnome a sending stone, telling him to use it in a time of great peril, and she would aid him if she could.

— As the party turned to leave, Garaele also mentioned that a friendly banshee had once lived on the outskirts of Phandalin and had provided the town with invaluable alchemical components and healing potions. She asked the adventurers to check in on her if they got the chance.

— Once the party had made their way back across the square, Rook hesitated, feeling a strange burning sensation against his back. It turned out to be the ruby he’d pocketed at the dwarven excavation. The Dragonborn unexpectedly summoned Bungheap, prompting some
nearby villagers to scatter, a few looking back over their shoulders with disapproval. 

— Bungheap’s reappearance caused a stir among the party, with Jøst and Gizmo in particular expressing their displeasure at the creature’s presence. Bungheap was equally displeased to be informed that there was no killing to be done. Rook instructed the quasit to climb into his pack, a command which the fiend reluctantly obeyed.

— There was then some debate about what to do next, brought to a close by a sudden and furious outburst by Rook, who demanded that the party go to Gnomengarde and complete the other job given to them by Harbin Wester. Gizmo, displeased with his companion’s attitude, threw a pebble at Rook, who somehow managed to restrain himself and not retaliate.

— Most of the party seemed content with the plan to go to Gnomengarde… all save for Gizmo, who said that the visit would not be fun, and that the gnomes were “assholes”. In spite of his protests, the group departed, making their way southeast toward the Sword Mountains, at the foothills of which awaited the small community of Gnomengarde.

— The Doomed Fools noticed strange conical swathes of freeze damage on the grasses of the foothills. Rook studied these traces, but was only able to verify that they were indeed caused by a dragon. He could not glean the dragon’s size or age, and was evasive to all questions from the party regarding the extent of his draconic knowledge.

— As the day drew to a close, a shadow seemed to pass over the party, compelling Bract, Jøst, and Gizmo to peer out toward the distant mountain peaks, the hair standing up on the backs of their necks.

— After making camp, Jøst once more departed to scout the surrounding environs, confirming that the party was indeed alone and there were no lurking enemies in the twilight. He returned with more herbs for Bract, who remarked on the wonders of nature and its potential for healing. Jøst noticed Tor staring at the monk and frowning, but was unable to determine the cause of the bard’s disapproval.

— Rook took the opportunity to send Bungheap out into the wilds, hoping the quasit might exhaust himself and return in a more docile mood. Against all the odds, the quasit did not get into any trouble, returning with the headless body of a squirrel, which the fiend dropped at the feet of its master. Gizmo quickly claimed the “treasure”.

— Rook once more attempted to play his ocarina, producing a chorus of shrill sounds which prompted Tor to double down on his promise to become the Dragonborn’s music instructor, if for no other reason than to spare his sensitive ears from such sounds in the future.

— The next morning the party spotted a side trail leading down into a grotto at the base of the mountains, where they discovered a waterfall feeding an alpine pool. A narrow path along the mountainside led to the entrance to Gnomengarde, hidden behind the waterfall.

— Two rock gnome sentries armed with crossbows greeted the party, elated to be visited by anyone other than orcs and goblins. They informed the travelers that all was not well in Gnomengarde, for their king had apparently lost his mind and sealed himself and the queen in their royal chambers, and two other gnomes had disappeared in the last few weeks.

— Before the party could enter, the sentries spotted Gizmo and their demeanor completely changed. They identified the wizard as the Exiled Prince, and reminded him that he had been forbidden from ever returning to Gnomengarde. Gizmo seemed entirely unrepentant and unbothered, trying to talk his way past the guards, who were adamant in their refusal to grant him access.

— After some deliberation which culminated in Jøst furiously grabbing Gizmo by the beard and telling him to stay put, the party left the gnome behind, continuing on into the compound without him. 

— The Fools marveled at the beauty of the main cavern, where rock gnomes bustled under the bioluminescent glow of mushrooms and shafts of sunlight, shooting the adventurers curious looks (and wide grins) whenever they felt their eyes upon them. 

— A statue of Garl Glittergold loomed at the center of the main vestibule, its stone eyes seeming to follow the group as they made their way to the grand stairs at the opposing end of the cavern.

— The royal guards directed the Fools to speak with Chief Inventors Fibblestib and Dabbledob (Fib and Dab), who had reluctantly stepped up as interim leaders in the king and queen’s absence.

— Fib quickly (and proudly) detailed his plan to restore the King to his former self, showing off his latest invention: the Ray of Sanity, a device which vaguely resembled a crossbow, albeit one made of crystals and mushrooms. Fib extolled the virtues of the device, claiming that it was all but finished, and required only a test subject to verify that it was in working order.

— Rook stepped forward (perhaps against his better judgment), volunteering to test the device. Dab cautioned the Dragonborn that it might be a bad idea, questioning what it truly meant to be “more sane”, but Rook would not be dissuaded. 

— With glee, Fib aimed the device and fired, enveloping Rook in a magical cloud of spores which quickly disappeared up his nostrils. 

— After a tense few seconds, Rook’s eyes focused once more, shining with a newfound degree of intellect. Fib, seeing that the Dragonborn was not visibly harmed, declared the experiment a wild success. Dab, less impressed, reminded everyone that the king was still locked in his chambers, and there was the matter of the disappearances which remained unresolved.

— With the Chief Inventors’ permission, the party ascended the grand stairway to the throne room, and, under the watchful gaze of the royal guard, made their way to the locked door behind the throne.

— King Korboz answered Rook’s knock with some hesitation, quickly identifying him as an outsider. Bract intervened to warn the king of the dragon, and suggested that he seal the main entrance to the community. King Korboz would not hear of it, frantically recounting his experience of being attacked by a dark “mirror” of himself. He insisted that he and the queen would not leave their chambers or address any other issues until he was presented with proof of the shade’s demise.

— Begrudgingly determined to find the creature, the party departed the throne room and were surprised to find Gizmo waiting for them just outside the chamber. Claiming to have entered through another means, Gizmo suggested that the party follow him to the Treasury, where they might find some valuable items.

— After the party agreed, Gizmo led them down the stairs, his fingers trailing along the stone wall. He stopped suddenly, drew a symbol on the stone with his fingertips, then the wall shuddered and parted, revealing a dusty, cobweb-strewn passageway.

— The passageway led the party deeper into the royal compound, ending with another hidden door in the wall just outside of the Treasury.

— Unable to suppress its violent instincts any longer, the doppelgänger (still in the form of Gizmo) drew a grotesque bone dagger from its belt and drove it deep into Rook’s side, devastatingly wounding the cleric.

— The doppelgänger, now in its true, monstrous form, took advantage of the party’s surprise, raining blows upon them and badly injuring Bract in the process.

— Tor focused on healing the injured Fools while Bract, Jøst, and Rook unleashed their combined fury upon the doppelgänger, which proved a nimble and difficult foe to hit. 

— In the midst of the chaos, the real Gizmo used one of his remaining Scrolls of Teleport to appear in the Treasury just beyond the corridor, looking as surprised to see his companions as they were to see him. 

— Gizmo recovered from his shock and cast Toll of the Dead on the doppelgänger, causing the creature to cover its ears in agony. Unfortunately, Gizmo’s appearance also alerted the two Lesser Mimics hidden in the Treasury, one of which spit a gob of acid on the wizard.

— Taking advantage of the doppelgänger’s vulnerability, Bract and Rook both landed powerful hits on the monstrosity.

— Jøst stabbed the doppelgänger with his short sword before distancing himself and training his sights on the mimics, who, sensing the threat, quickly surrounded the ranger, attacking to no avail as he danced around their strikes.

— Gizmo, in an act of revenge for having been incapacitated and impersonated, sprinted toward the monstrosity, clambered up its back and grabbed its head in his hands, blasting it with a powerful display of necromancy and sucking the very life force out of it, slaying the foul beast.

— Exhausted and injured, the party regrouped and made their way into the treasury, where Rook once more revealed a more larcenous side, scanning the space for anything particularly valuable. He learned, to his dismay, that the rock gnomes’ idea of treasure was quite different from other cultures, and found only half-finished experiments, components, cogs, gears, and piles of inscrutable devices.

— Gizmo, more familiar with the Treasury’s contents, was able to discern a staff jutting from one of the piles, and claimed it as his own. He then strode out into the corridor and cast raise dead on the lifeless body of the doppelgänger, rationalizing the act as a way to provide proof to his father that the creature was slain…

# Notable Actions:
— Rook uncharacteristically lost his temper while the party deliberated about their next steps, then summoned Bungheap in Phandalin’s town square. He appeared to take on a parental role to the quasit, a creature of pure and unrelenting evil. Outside of Gnomengarde, Rook took note of the unmistakeable signs of an ice dragon, and later asked Chief Inventor Fibblestib if he would be able to fashion equipment from the creature’s remains.

— Bract continued to show a flair for cooking, shocking Toblen Stonehill by improving on an old family recipe. He was secretive and somewhat defensive when he was recognized by Sister Garaele, doubling down at camp later about his commitment to the beauty of nature and healing, and maintaining a disinterest in material gain. At Gnomengarde he seemed to have a vested interest in convincing the gnomes to seal off their community from the dragon threat, and in battle he unveiled the full ferocity of his martial arts.

— Jøst revealed the extent to which he will not tolerate the presence of monsters and fiends, swearing that he would take the head of Bungheap the quasit. He otherwise kept his cool, becoming a stoic and reliable anchor in a sometimes chaotic group of travelers. Upon arriving at Gnomengarde, he was visibly discomfited by the hustle and bustle of the community, though when it came time to battle, he shrugged off a mighty blow from the  doppelgänger and nimbly avoid the gnashing fangs of the mimics.

— Gizmo was particularly enamored with Sister Garaele, convincing the venerable maiden to give him a sending stone (while steadfastly ignoring her insights into his inner conflict). His checkered past caught up to him outside of Gnomengarde, where he was recognized as the Exiled Prince Gizmo Tinkertits and denied entry to his former home. He showed no remorse for this, and later cast several necrotic spells, culminated his raising of the dead doppelgänger. He also retrieved a staff from the Gnomengarde treasury, an artifact of untold power and an heirloom of the Tinkertits family line.
